# Essentials-of-Data-structures

Essential algorithms added in notebook to cover the most of datastructure problems in interview world.

like Hash maps, heaps ,tries, graphs, Quicksort, Mergesort, Binary search, depth-first search, breadth0-first search,
trees, lists, combinations, dynamic programming, parenthesis, tries, matrices, greedy search, parenthese (mintoadd, val==-1)

Each problem given with multiple possible solutions from O(n2 or n!) approach to O(n) or O(logn) whichiver suits best approach.

## Code Optimization techniques
1 . Compile Time evaluation 
    a. Constant Folding:  
        Evaluating the expression whose operands known
        vals = val than exprssion 
        
    b. Constant Propogations

2. Common sum Expression elimination 
    a. Removing redundant expressions with functions. 

3. Strength reduction
    Replace expresionns with more prioriy with less priority expressions 
    
4. Code movement
    move a block of code outside loop if it wont have importance

5. Dead code elimination
